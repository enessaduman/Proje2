    "Instructions": "To make the pastry, place the flour and salt in a large bowl.\nMix well.\nAdd the cubes of butter and shortening and mix them in (I like to use my hands to mix the fat into the flour, but you can use a pastry blender) just until it looks like coarse oatmeal with some pea-sized bits remaining.\nPlace the egg in a 2-cup measure and beat it with a fork.\n\n\nStir this into the flour mixture, just until the dough clings together.\nI like to use my hands for this part as well, but a wooden spoon would also work.\nTry not to overmix it.\nOn a lightly floured surface, gather the dough into a ball and divide it into 5 evenly sized portions.\nShape each portion into a disc and wrap tightly in plastic.\nChill 2 of these discs for 1 hour.\nFreeze the other 3 in a resealable freezer bag for future use.\nThe pastry keeps well in the freezer for up to 2 months.\nPreheat the oven to 350°F.\nPlace the rack in the lower third of the oven.\nLine a baking sheet with aluminum foil to catch drippings.\nOn a lightly floured surface, roll out 1 disc of pastry into a 12-inch circle, or thereabouts.\nPlace it in the bottom of a 9-inch pie plate, with the pastry overhanging the edges of the pie plate.\nTo make the filling, place the saskatoon berries in a large bowl and stir in the 1/2 cup sugar and the cornstarch until well combined.\nPour the berry mixture into the bottom of the pie.\nDot with the butter.\nOn a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry in another 12-inch circle for the top crust.\nUse a ruler to guide you when cutting the pastry into 6 wide, long strips to keep the edges straight.\nSave the 2 end pieces in case you need to do any patching.\nI like wide strips, but if you like a thinner look, feel free to cut thin strips of pastry.\nWeave the pastry strips, going over and under, making sure they connect with the edges of the pie crust.\nFold over the edges of the bottom crust, tucking in the lattice ends.\nThis will help to trap the juices and give a rustic look.\nIf you prefer a cleaner, tidier look, you can trim the overhanging pieces and crimp the edges with a fork.\n\n\nSprinkle with the remaining Tbsp sugar.\n\n\nRemove the pie from the oven and place it on a wire rack to cool.\nServe the pie warm or at room temperature with whipped cream or ice cream.\nMakes 6 servings.\nThis keeps well if covered with plastic and refrigerated for up to 4 days.\n\n\n<a href=\"https://canadianfoodfocus.org/canadian-food-stories/classic-canadian-recipes-saskatoon-pie/#recipe\"></a><img src=\"/images/icons/source_icon.png\" width=\"64\" alt=\"Source Icon\" title=\"Source\">\nhttps://canadianfoodfocus.org/canadian-food-stories/classic-canadian-recipes-saskatoon-pie/#recipe\n<!-- Close Feature -->\n<!--/#footer--><script src=\"/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js\"></script>\n",

    "Instructions": "To make the pastry, place the flour and salt in a large bowl.\nMix well.\nAdd the cubes of butter and shortening and mix them in (I like to use my hands to mix the fat into the flour, but you can use a pastry blender) just until it looks like coarse oatmeal with some pea-sized bits remaining.\nPlace the egg in a 2-cup measure and beat it with a fork.\n\n\nStir this into the flour mixture, just until the dough clings together.\nI like to use my hands for this part as well, but a wooden spoon would also work.\nTry not to overmix it.\nOn a lightly floured surface, gather the dough into a ball and divide it into 5 evenly sized portions.\nShape each portion into a disc and wrap tightly in plastic.\nChill 2 of these discs for 1 hour.\nFreeze the other 3 in a resealable freezer bag for future use.\nThe pastry keeps well in the freezer for up to 2 months.\nPreheat the oven to 350°F.\nPlace the rack in the lower third of the oven.\nLine a baking sheet with aluminum foil to catch drippings.\nOn a lightly floured surface, roll out 1 disc of pastry into a 12-inch circle, or thereabouts.\nPlace it in the bottom of a 9-inch pie plate, with the pastry overhanging the edges of the pie plate.\nTo make the filling, place the saskatoon berries in a large bowl and stir in the 1/2 cup sugar and the cornstarch until well combined.\nPour the berry mixture into the bottom of the pie.\nDot with the butter.\nOn a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry in another 12-inch circle for the top crust.\nUse a ruler to guide you when cutting the pastry into 6 wide, long strips to keep the edges straight.\nSave the 2 end pieces in case you need to do any patching.\nI like wide strips, but if you like a thinner look, feel free to cut thin strips of pastry.\nWeave the pastry strips, going over and under, making sure they connect with the edges of the pie crust.\nFold over the edges of the bottom crust, tucking in the lattice ends.\nThis will help to trap the juices and give a rustic look.\nIf you prefer a cleaner, tidier look, you can trim the overhanging pieces and crimp the edges with a fork.\n\n\nSprinkle with the remaining Tbsp sugar.\n\n\nRemove the pie from the oven and place it on a wire rack to cool.\nServe the pie warm or at room temperature with whipped cream or ice cream.\nMakes 6 servings.\nThis keeps well if covered with plastic and refrigerated for up to 4 days.\n\n\n<a href=\"https://canadianfoodfocus.org/canadian-food-stories/classic-canadian-recipes-saskatoon-pie/#recipe\"></a><img src=\"/images/icons/source_icon.png\" width=\"64\" alt=\"Source Icon\" title=\"Source\">\nhttps://canadianfoodfocus.org/canadian-food-stories/classic-canadian-recipes-saskatoon-pie/#recipe\n<!-- Close Feature -->\n<!--/#footer--><script src=\"/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js\"></script>\n",

    "Instructions": "Twist the heads from the prawns, then peel away the legs and shells, but leave the tails intact.\nDevein each prawn.\nFry the shells in 1 tbsp oil for 5 mins, until dark pink and golden in patches.\nAdd the wine, boil down by two thirds, then pour in the stock.\nStrain into a jug, discarding the shells.\nHeat the rest of the oil in a deep frying pan or casserole.\nAdd the fennel, onion and garlic, season, then cover and gently cook for 10 mins until softened.\nMeanwhile, peel the potato and cut into 2cm-ish chunks.\n\n\nDrain in a colander.\nPeel a strip of zest from the orange.\nPut the zest, star anise, bay and ½ tsp harissa into the pan.\nFry gently, uncovered, for 5-10 mins, until the vegetables are soft, sweet and golden.\nStir in the tomato purée, cook for 2 mins, then add the tomatoes and stock.\nSimmer for 10 mins until the sauce thickens slightly.\nSeason to taste.\nThe sauce can be made ahead, then reheated later in the day.\nMeantime, scrub the mussels or clams and pull away any stringy beards.\nAny that are open should be tapped sharply on the worktop – if they don’t close after a few seconds, discard them.\nReheat the sauce if necessary, then stir the potato, chunks of fish and prawns very gently into the stew.\n\n\nScatter the mussels or clams over the stew, then cover and cook for 2 mins more or until the shells have opened wide.\nDiscard any that remain closed.\nThe chunks of fish should flake easily and the prawns should be pink through.\nScatter with the thyme leaves.\nTo make the quick rouille, stir the rest of the harissa through the mayonnaise.\nServe the stew in bowls, topped with spoonfuls of rouille, which will melt into the sauce and enrich it.\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/532640/summer-fish-stew-with-rouille\"></a><img src=\"/images/icons/source_icon.png\" width=\"64\" alt=\"Source Icon\" title=\"Source\">\nhttps://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/532640/summer-fish-stew-with-rouille\n<!-- Close Feature -->\n<!--/#footer--><script src=\"/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js\"></script>\n",
